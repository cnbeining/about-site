# Tech Generic Docs

## Write Commit Messages

Effective Feb 20, 2023, we adopt the commit message convention as follows for all One Among Us repositories:

> [*] Do something

The message should be written in English. Starting with a mark symbol in square brackets and separated by a space character, the headline should be a imperative sentence describing what you do and end without punctuation marks. Detailed descriptions are not mandatory but recommended if you find it complicated. We follow the 72-column line-wrapping rule.

**Marks**
> [+] Add
>
> [-] Remove
>
> [U] Update
>
> [O] Optimize
>
> [F] Fix
>
> [S] Modify style
>
> [M] Move (also [M] Modify by convention but [U] Modify is recommended)
>
> [R] Refactor
>
> [T] Test
>
> [D] Tweak documentation
>
> [B] Backup
>
> [PR] Merge commit of pull request

**Examples**

> [+] Add entry for sauricat
>
> [U] Update photos for sauricat
>
> [F] Fix punctuation
